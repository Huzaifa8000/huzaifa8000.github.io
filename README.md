# About Me
## My Interests
I enjoy reading, gaming, drawing, listening to music, coding apps/websites, and solving puzzles. I also like to play volleyball and basketball. 
## Websites I Recommend 
-[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)  -I love this website because it's so versatile. You can use YouTube to listen to music, keep up with your favorite content creators, or learn a new skill. I recently learned how to solve a Rubik's cube with the help of a YouTube video.

-[1440](https://discover.join1440.com/)  -I highly recommend this website for its daily newsletter that provides unbiased, easily digestible news across various categories. In a digital age where information can be unreliable and biased, 1440 is an invaluable resource for understanding current events worldwide.
